# trustpilot-widget
A widget created for a coding challenge from Trustpilot. The challenge was part of a job application for a front end developer position.
I'm new to web development, but I liked this challenge, and made a try. I used Materialize CSS framework, and used jQuery for the coding part. Trustpilot provided the data source for the project.
