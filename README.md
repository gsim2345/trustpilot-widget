# trustpilot-widget
A widget created for a coding challenge from Trustpilot. The challenge was part of a job application challenge for an advanced web developer position. https://jobs.trustpilot.com/position/473740
I'm new to web development, but I liked this challenge, and made a try. I used Materialize CSS framework, and used jQuery for the coding part.
